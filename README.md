**_Usage_**

To run the demo, simply run the following command: `python3 semantic-kernel-demo.py`. This will start the chatbot and prompt you for input. You can enter any text and the chatbot will respond with a message.

**_Plugins_**

This demo project includes two plugins:

1. **OrchestratorPlugin**: This plugin is responsible for routing user input to the appropriate function then to Azure OpenAI.

2. **StocksReaderPlugin**: This plugin is responsible for fetching stock data from the Dubai Financial Market.

_You can add your own plugins by creating a new Python file in the plugins directory and defining a class that implements the necessary functions (Check the YourPlugin class in plugins/yourplugin.py for a faster start)_
